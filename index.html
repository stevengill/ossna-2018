                        Fil: Adobe and Open Source don't traditionally go hand in hand.
                        Interestingly, Adobe has been involved in OS. Like open sourcing
                        flex and contributing to various other Apache projects. 
                        You still wouldn't thing of adobe as an open source company.
                        Is this a preception problem or something else?

                        the open source culture at Adobe. It was a grass roots

                        responsibilities part of their day jobs. But the thing 
                        that brought them together was a shared love of open 
                        source and their desire to have Adobe to give back to 
                        the community.

                        the submission process! So we started to gather
                        all of the requirements from all of the various teams
                        involved in the OS process. We took those requirements
                        and created a checklist for teams to follow.</aside>

                    <img src="images/os-submission-checklist.png" style="margin-top: 0; width:51%" />
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Steve: To manage the process, we created a git repo on our 
                        internal github. We put the checklist of all 
                        of the requirements into a issue_template. Every
                        submitter was required to create an issue in our repo 
                        and start filling out the checklist in the issue 
                        template. One big benifit of this new process meant
                        that it was open and transparent. Anyone could view
                        previous submissions and see how they went. We wanted
                        to remove the mystrey behind the approvals. Over time 
                        and many discussions with various stakeholders, the list
                        grew to 53 items. The process was still daunting and 
                        a little confusing. Our plan was for the checklist to
                        be a first pass. It was quick to get up and it allowed
                        us to build relationships with the stakeholders. It gave
                        us at the open source office to learn the nuances
                        of contributing to and open sourcing code. So earlier 
                        this year, from our learnings, we launched the new open
                        source submission form. (Hand it off to Fil to talk about that)

                        Fil: The new submission form is radically simplier. We

                        simple and direct ones. Easier to understand for 
                        developers instead of lawyers. We created categorizes of 
                        open source projects that the open source office would
                        be able to approve without going through all of the 
                        stakeholders.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Fil: Essentially: any questions that tend to come up from 
                        newcomers, we make a note of it and see if the info can 
                        fit into the handbook. In this way it organically grows 
                        and becomes more useful over time. 
                        
                        Opensource.google.com/docs is a huge inspiration for 
                        this. It is gold standard.
                        
                        Today, our handbook contains centralized releasing 
                        documentation(npm, docker, maven central, chef).
                        Info about how we manage github.com/adobe and how to get
                        access. Also cotains info about our CLA
                        
                        The handbook started out with a focus open source, but 
                        has been bleeding into a generic engineering handbook.

                        Goal is to open source it and hand it out to new hires 
                        as part of onboarding

                        areas, with a focus on answering why and how to 
                        document:

                            Governance: how do we add people to the project? Who 
                                has permissions in the project? What are the 
                                social rituals in the project?

                        we pull from GitHub (which we will touch on in a few 
                        slides). Outstanding OS contributor which is based on

                        formal employee recognition program for OS which we hope

                        Steve: It was really important for us to have ways to

                        promote Adobe OS projects to external developer

                        First we created the internal developer
                        newsletter. It wasn't focused on just open source, but
                        all internal tech news. We added every developer
                        at the company to the newsletter. We use a git repo to 
                        take submissions for what to include.

                        We also created #guild-opensource. A company wide slack
                        channel to for all of the os enthusiests to gather and 
                        discuss whatever is on their mind.

                        Fil: Adobe is traditionally siloed
                        Today, the open source office is composed of a group of 
                        developers, marketing and legal. Very rare to have
                        a cross organizational team like us in the company.
                        We sit under the developer relations org. Would be more 
                        ideal if we sat under the CEOs office.

                        Our role is more about bringing people together. We see
                        ourselves as more of a central team to all of Adobe.
